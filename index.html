Experiencing films in an era of media proliferation can be seen as both a blessing and a curse. It’s a blessing that films become increasingly accessible to many and it’s a curse that the amount of access can alter completely on how movies are consumed. Everything becomes digitized and watching films can no longer be a collective experience. This is not to dismiss the advancement of streaming services, but it is worth acknowledging the pros and cons of encountering films in 2018. 
Apart from big names such as Hulu, Amazon Prime and Netflix, streaming services, such as MUBI and Filmstruck, helps younger audiences to be exposed to older and archived films when it is not showing in nearby theaters. The curatorial aspect of these two streaming services offers a different kind of experience in which it gives viewers the opportunity to dive deeper into the catalogue within the genre or perhaps a specific director’s obscure filmography, accompanied by video essays and interviews. This amount of accessibility might as well feed a person’s knowledge and gives them the benefit of in-depth history and insights from a well-respected source. 
Another advantage in these platforms is the student discount. MUBI, however, followed suit recently by giving the full advantage of free subscription for college students while Filmstruck expanded their library by collaborating with TCM that is also included in the discount along with their current Criterion Collection channel. All in all, streaming services allow oneself to revisit their favorite films – albeit, countless times - with just a click away. The other option is to order DVD on Amazon or Ebay, wait for it to come for a week or two or even a day if one is an Amazon Prime member and watch it on their DVD players. Consumers are spoiled and more than that, streaming services are always present for those who are remote from theaters. The totality of this exposure gives an abundance of benefits who are stuck in the domestic sphere or on a budget. As long as Wi-Fi and computers are around, there’s no need to be concern on how to access and watch films. 
Similar to small children being spoiled, the existence of streaming services managed to convince consumers that it is better to stay at home and wait for the digital version of the movies they want to see to be available instead of going out. It perhaps can cost less than the amount they desire to spend traveling to the theater and buying the tickets. Nevertheless, it arguable that it is vital to experience films on a larger format. Even so, it’s important to see films the way it’s intended to be seen: whether it’s DCP, 35mm or 70mm. Unfortunately, streaming services doesn’t provide these other than its sophisticated curation of films. The original visual aspects gets watered down and everything turns into High Definition. As much as thrilling it is to see things in HD, it defeats the purpose of its original form. More often than not, the visual quality informs the narrative that demands to be acknowledged. 
Another aspect that digital platforms and streaming services tend to diminish is its quality of sounds. We are hearing the film in a small scale which therefore also defeats the purpose of having sound design. For example, Fritz Lang’s eerie thriller M or Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation, two films that rely on its sound design. Particularly with thriller and horror films, the sounds tend to be greater on a bigger scale, more effective compared to when we listen to it through headphones or loudspeaker from computers or the latest version of a flat-screen television.
Engagement and looking at cinema as a collective is starting to fade away as streaming services conquer. The act of moviegoing or watching films becomes individualized or privatize. Written in the pre-streaming era and at a time where television content was beginning to emerge, Susan Sontag managed to reflect in her essay, aptly titled “The Decay of Cinema” (1996), on the desire to be taken away by the moving pictures right in front of you. Sontag says of the experience, “to be kidnapped was to be overwhelmed by the physical presence of the image. The experience of "going to the movies" was part of it. To see a great film only on television isn't to have really seen that film.” We are glued to the beds and sofas in our homes that we no longer consider of experiencing it in the dark, immersing in the with the others as an exciting idea. In an article titled from the New York Times, published on April 2016 titled “In An Era of Streaming, Cinema is Under Attack” by A. Scott and Manohla Dargis, Dargis says that “the key word here is people. After all, what makes movies a mass art is that they are made on a mass scale for a mass audience, which is true even for work that’s largely exhibited on the festival and art-cinema circuit.” So, what will happen if people stop going to the theaters? 
 Furthermore, there’s a loose discipline when it comes to watching films at home. Audience can easily give into their impulse of checking their phones, text and check their social media. Therefore, it’s easy to dismiss films as “boring” and one can simply exit or close the tabs on their browser whenever they are no longer interested and then proceed to the Wikipedia page of the film to find out more. In the end, watching movies on your computer or laptop is akin to admiring someone from afar.  In the same essay, Sontag says of this notion that “the conditions of paying attention in a domestic space are radically disrespectful of film. Now that a film no longer has a standard size, home screens can be as big as living room or bedroom walls.” Film is the kind of art form that demands to be paid attention to. It also serves as an entertainment but what good does one get out of it if they are played in the background as an accompaniment while they’re on their phones or cleaning up their spaces? 
Cinema isn’t dead. It’s still there and indeed it’s going to die when people decided to collectively stop going to the cinema and rely on digitized version of this art form that is meant to be seen on a bigger scale. In the end, it’s all in the matter of how we consume it. Don’t lean in closer to your computer, iPad or your phones. Go out when you can. Go to the nearest theater. Don’t take them for granted because you never know what you have until it’s gone.
