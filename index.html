Experiencing films in an era of media proliferation can be seen as both a blessing and a curse. 
    It’s a blessing that films become increasingly accessible to many and it’s a curse that the amount of access can 
    alter completely on how movies are consumed. Everything becomes digitized and watching films can no longer be 
    a collective experience. This is not to dismiss the advancement of streaming services, 
    but it is worth acknowledging the pros and cons of encountering films in 2018. 
    Apart from big names such as Hulu, Amazon Prime and Netflix, streaming services, such as MUBI and Filmstruck, 
    helps younger audiences to be exposed to older and archived films when it is not showing in nearby theaters. T
    he curatorial aspect of these two streaming services offers a different kind of experience in which it gives 
    viewers the opportunity to dive deeper into the catalogue within the genre or perhaps a specific director’s 
    obscure filmography, accompanied by video essays and interviews. This amount of accessibility might as well 
    feed a person’s knowledge and gives them the benefit of in-depth history and insights from a well-respected source.
    Another advantage in these platforms is the student discount. MUBI, however, followed suit recently by giving the 
    full advantage of free subscription for college students while Filmstruck expanded their library by collaborating 
    with TCM that is also included in the discount along with their current Criterion Collection channel. 
    All in all, streaming services allow oneself to revisit their favorite films – albeit, countless times 
    - with just a click away. The other option is to order DVD on Amazon or Ebay, wait for it to come for a 
    week or two or even a day if one is an Amazon Prime member and watch it on their DVD players. 
    Consumers are spoiled and more than that, streaming services are always present for those who are remote from theaters.
    The totality of this exposure gives an abundance of benefits who are stuck in the domestic sphere or on a budget. 
    As long as Wi-Fi and computers are around, there’s no need to be concern on how to access and watch films. 
    Similar to small children being spoiled, the existence of streaming services managed to convince consumers that 
    it is better to stay at home and wait for the digital version of the movies they want to see to be available 
    instead of going out. It perhaps can cost less than the amount they desire to spend traveling to the theater a
    nd buying the tickets. Nevertheless, it arguable that it is vital to experience films on a larger format. 
    Even so, it’s important to see films the way it’s intended to be seen: whether it’s DCP, 35mm or 70mm. U
    nfortunately, streaming services doesn’t provide these other than its sophisticated curation of films. 
    The original visual aspects gets watered down and everything turns into High Definition. 
    As thrilling as it is to see things in HD, it defeats the purpose of its original form. More often than not, 
    the visual quality informs the narrative that demands to be acknowledged.
