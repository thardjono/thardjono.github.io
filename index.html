     <div class="row"><p><center> THEIR FACES ARE familiar for the feelings of horror and shame they produce
        in me. Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi in 1961's "Breakfast at Tiffany's", stumbling
        around his Manhattan apartment in a blue bathrobe, his face contorted - lips barely closing
        over grotesquely pronounced buckteeth, slicked-back hair dyed jet black. Ashton Kutcher
        as a Bollywood producer, Raj, in a 2012 commercial, his skin darkened, a brown mustache affixed
        to his face, speaking in a cheap singsong voice, swaying his body which is clad in a bright
        blue silk sherwani, back and forth to imitate the Indian head waggle. Tilda Swinton, otherworldly
        in her beauty as always, but monkishly bald as the Ancient One, a character originally
        intended to be Tibetan in 2016's "Doctor Strange." More subtle, but still just as shocking:
        Emma Stone - blonde and green eyed - As Allison Ng, leaning against a kitchen island in a scene
        from 2015's "Aloha" and saying, "My dad was half Chinese, half Hawaiian," as breezily as if she
        were saying goodbye to someone on the telephone.I, too, am half Chinese, though I have always been told (by other Chinese-Americans,
          by white people who were under the impression I was one of them) that I'm not the right kind of Chinese.
          I'm over six feet tall and my eyelids have creases, and I have come to anticipate the pause in a conversation with
          strangers as I watch them — like someone calculating the size of someone else’s apartment —
          square the fact of my ethnicity with my appearance. I have never quite seen myself on-screen.
          <br>
        <p>Maybe in Keanu Reeves or Olivia Munn, but even so, the side of myself that is understood as Asian — that is seen —
          is as washed away as theirs, and that is because we live in a world that doesn't make time for ambiguity, that continues to reward whiteness with privilege.Having been raised on a mediocre diet of American television and mainstream Hollywood movies, I can count
            on one hand the actors of Asian descent who made an impression on me growing up. Their performances have stayed with me,
            like a novel you may never read again but pack with you every time you move.</p></div>

 <center><p> THERE HAVE BEEN attempts by Hollywood to insert real people of color - in this case, Asian-Americans - into the cultural landscape of
          film and television. Most recently, Daniel Wu was cast as Lu Ren in this year's "Tomb Raider", starring Alicia Vikander.
          He was as good-looking as he was complicated, but where typically there might have been some chemistry between two young
          and beautiful people embarking on a grand adventure, Wu was relegated by the end to the benign, if handsome, friend. T
          he television reboot "Hawaii Five-0" has added more nuanced Asian characters who were missing from the original version,
          played by actors such as Grace Park, Daniel Dae Kim or Masi Oka, and newer creations, including "Silicon Valley", have cast Jimmy O.
          Yang and Kumail Nanjiani in stereotypical but still more rewardingly complex supporting roles (Yang plays a ruthless
          if talentless app developer; Nanjiani, as a software engineer, steals the scene in nearly every episode).
          But these are still small changes, and this so-called progress rings hollow. You remain unlikely to see Asian-Americans
          in lead roles in big studios films without the hint of tokenism, even after the box office success of this year's "Crazy Rich Asians",
        the first studio film with an all-Asian cast since "The Joy Luck Club" in 1993.<p></center></div>
