<h1>Pawel Pawlikowski on 'Cold War', the Divinity of Absolute Love, and the Political
      Backlash to 'Ida' in Poland</h1>
    <h2>by Ed Ranki</h2>
    <h3>October 8 2018</h3>
<section><p>Pawel Pawlikowski Cold War, a sweeping saga of a doomed romance that crisscrosses 1950s Europe, comes five years after the release of his Oscar-winning Ida. Two superb films in, Pawlikowski has found a niche in black-and-white historical drama set in his native Poland, where he moved after spending his career in the UK. But Cold War’s rich, jazz-soaked love story has a different beat to the relatively austere Ida, and it’s notched up rave reviews since its premiere in Cannes.
The former academic, dressed in a suit, jeans, and sunglasses hanging from the top of his T-shirt, is erudite but combative as we meet at the San Sebastián Film Festival, pushing back on what he calls simplistic interpretations of Ida and Cold War, as well as offering his thoughts on populism in Europe and Poland’s controversial Holocaust law.

   <p><b>The Film Stage: Cold War won Best Director at Cannes. What would you say has connected audiences and
   critics with it?<p></b>

  <p><b>Pawel Pawlikowski</b>: It’s hard to say, but I imagine it’s a powerful story in all
   its ambiguities and contradictions. It’s a very unusual, eccentric story, so I didn’t realize how many people
   would still find their way into it. A lot of people have come up to me and said “It’s exactly like my story.”
   But no it isn’t — it’s Cold War, it’s communism, it’s exile. But they still find something of their own fragmented
   love story, perhaps of the impossibility of love.</p>

   <p><b>TFS: So is Cold War a metaphor that says love is ultimately doomed?</p></b>

   <p><b>PP</b>: No.This is a very specific story. It’s not that doomed, you know. There’s a kind of happy ending! But the
   fact is that we expect something absolute to come out of love–traditions from the troubadours to 19th-century literature.
   It’s an interesting dramatic problem because love never is absolute; it always goes through stages–different contexts,
   different people. We’re always disappointed. Time corrupts things. Absolute love is the domain of the divine and
   in human terms the quest for something absolute always leads to comic and tragic effects.</p>

   <p><b>TFS: Even today, internet dating trains us to think perfect love is achievable...</p></b>

<p><b>PP</b>: This is an era when so much of the emotional life happens in the digital sphere. A lot of people don’t look at each
other–only on telephones and they meet on the internet. It doesn’t mean that there isn’t love. But it’s difficult
to capture and show it in a form. Whereas in a time when there were fewer distractions and people had to face each
other it’s slightly more interesting to show.I think that these days couples don’t last very long.
So it’s so difficult for that couple to survive all the twists and turns and the obstacles thrown in their way
— political, technical, exile, absence from each other. They kind of enhances this thing. Love.
The thing is I’m not sure what love is in Cold War–at no point are they very happy! There are moments where it’s nice,
but nothing is ever satisfying and pure. It immediately gets corrupted and veers off into something else. It’s only at the end o
f the story when they have no more strength to fight that they find themselves alone and nobody can understand them
as well as each other and you can say that was a great love story. That was love. But it didn’t look like love.</p>
